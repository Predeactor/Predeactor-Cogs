### Bug report

If you encounter a problem during the installation of a cog and/or during its use, here is a list to follow to try to solve it without having to open an issue or to contact me:
- Try to update the repository: `[p]repo update`.
- Did you manually change the code? If yes, use the code available on the repo.
- Are you missing a module? If so, use the command `[p]pipinstall`.

If you still can't solve your problem, open an issue.
