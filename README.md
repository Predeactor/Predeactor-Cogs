# Again news! (13/5/2020)
Oh hey you, I hope you're doing well! You may wonder why I still didn't made the birthday and mail cog? Well, I just lose the motivation about them (*I didn't even start to write them*), but still, now I got 2 real project :
- A game where you should help someone, an interactive game made by me*TM*.
- A cog to explain you what is Python and how to make you own cog, without looking at the Red's Documentation (But I will use it).

That's all, stay home!

Also a cog to help you learn Python and making Red cogs, isn't that your dream?
