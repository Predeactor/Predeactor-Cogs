# Welcome to a new era? (04/6/2020)
Welcome everyone, here's a little update of what I made for abour 1 month.
So I started working on a free Cleverbot cog, and it actually work, some cleanup and I will push it to the repository soon.

About the Learning cog, it reached EoL, because at first, I (again) losed interest in doing it and I got some complication 
in doing it (Like functions for checking if the level is complete.). However I'll be glad to help you with little Python/cog
code issue (I don't replace a support channel!)

Sorry for those who was expecting a lot from this cog
