# Sweet Sweet Updates ! (12/06/2020)

Hey everyone, as I said, *and if I don't forget to fill this readme...*, I uploaded the brand new cog Cleverbot, which is completely free!
However, this cog is in Alpha, it mean that it's brand new and may have undesired behavior.

So, what now? Well, I'm thinking about a captcha cog. An image is sent, and you have to type the same number.

*Edit: I put the captcha cog somewhere else, and do it later, but now, I'm into a random, not useful names, adress, IP, and more generator*
*Who should you blame for that changement? @jack1142 for [sending the repo's link](https://discordapp.com/channels/133049272517001216/133081046869737472/723165864035221596) on Red
